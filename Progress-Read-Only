6817 Milton Street. No results shown, yet admin exists. --fixed, CVS orders have protected addresses.

Incorporate table og_view.envoy_deliveries dropoff_location_id to solve above^? Will need table key to access. 5/25 --Solved.

To-Do:
Check Home Depot searchability
IMPORTANT: https://admin.shipt.com/deliveries/10707587 this shoprite order only appears in the CVS query. But other shoprite orders that are similar to the address
do appear when searching with the other query. Is there potentially another customer address table?

Testing a new envoy delivery address search query. Performance so far has been much better! Average query run time is between 15-25 seconds and it has returned the same results as the current envoy search query (only much quicker):

select 'https://admin.shipt.com/deliveries/' || ed.id as "Order Admin"
     , ed.status
     , ts.starts_at :: DATE as "Date"
     , db.DROPOFF_CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME || ' ' || db.DROPOFF_CUSTOMER_LAST_NAME as "Customer Name"
     , db.DROPOFF_ADDRESS || ' ' || db.DROPOFF_ADDRESS_2 || ' ' || db.DROPOFF_ADDRESS_CITY || ' ' || db.DROPOFF_ADDRESS_STATE || ' ' || db.DROPOFF_ADDRESS_ZIP_CODE as "Delivery Address"
     , db.external_reference_id
from ng_views.DELIVERY_BROKER db
join og_views.envoy_deliveries ed on db.EXTERNAL_REFERENCE_ID = ed.external_reference_id
join og_views.time_slots ts ON ed.time_slot_id = ts.id
where "Delivery Address" ilike '%ADDRESS HERE%'
order by "Date" desc
;

NG_VIEWS.DELIVERY_BROKER query (did not work how we wanted it to but could be useful for general query structure/making connections down the line):

SELECT 
'https://admin.shipt.com/deliveries/' || EXTERNAL_REFERENCE_ID as "Order Admin",
DROPOFF_CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME || ' ' || DROPOFF_CUSTOMER_LAST_NAME  as "Customer Name",
DROPOFF_ADDRESS || DROPOFF_ADDRESS_2 || DROPOFF_ADDRESS_CITY || DROPOFF_ADDRESS_STATE || DROPOFF_ADDRESS_ZIP_CODE as "Delivery Address",
DELIVER_BY as "Delivery Date"

FROM 
NG_VIEWS.DELIVERY_BROKER

WHERE 
DROPOFF_ADDRESS ilike '%11276 Stonemill Farms%'

ORDER BY "Delivery Date" desc

LIMIT 100
