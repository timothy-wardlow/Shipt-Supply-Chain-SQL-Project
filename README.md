# Shipt-Supply-Chain-SQL-Project
 Primary Goals:
 Develop SQL queries to be used with Snowflake databases that are:
 a) compatible with NG Admin views
 b) optimized for quicker processing and response times

 Queries should contain connections to:
 Member/Customer addresses, Store addresses, Member/Customer last names, Order creation date, Order delivery window date/time, Order current status

 And Queries should return:
 Order numbers connected to admin links for Delivery Only order searches, and Marketplace/Platform Order searches
